# CLCI (count latin characters in image)

This is a simple python project that implements Google's tesseract-ocr in order to count the latin characters from a given image that also has arabic and/or chinese characters.

<!-- # Requirements

Main dependency is tesseract as it has to be installed on your local machine otherwise the script won't run. To install tesseract you can compile it from source [@tesseract's main repo](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) or download a installer from [Tesseract at UB Manheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

For further information read [Tesseract docs](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)

Other requirements are `opencv` and `pytesseract`
